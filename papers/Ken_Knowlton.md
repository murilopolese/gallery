Quote:

> “What the world needs is a massive consortium from science, math, social sciences, history, philosophy, religion, economics, business, politics -- to devise downsizing schemes, justified by world systems simulations, leading to safeguards, stockpiles, backups, plans-B, austerity triages, etc. The effort would need to be vastly multi-disciplinary and international. It's not likely to happen; without it we are implicitly saying full-steam-ahead to chaotic, choking disaster.
> Here's a wry suggestion: that we scientists and other thinkers form an SSSSSSSSSSSS which, by strained back-formation, might stand for Strategists for a Slower Slide down the Slippery Slope to Softer Settling into a Sane, Stable, Secure, Sustainable Society. Not very likely, of course, but wouldn't it be wonderful if a pandemic of intellectual and emotional sanity swept the world, leaving people infected with care, not about their gardens of ambition and entitlement, but about the future of humanity.”
